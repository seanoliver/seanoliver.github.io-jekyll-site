When I was first opted into Google's new tabbed inbox in Gmail, it immediately changed the way I used my email. It's similar to the effect DVR had on the way I experienced TV. Just like DVR, Gmail's tabs allow users to get to the content they care about without having to be pushed to buy some item they don't want or engage with some product they don't care about.

At the same time, I'm a marketer at a consumer web company, and like many internet marketers today, I rely on the email channel to get users using my products. It would be easy for me to feel frustrated about the change, and to seek out workarounds. But the hard truth is that the email marketing landscape has changed, and it's time we learn to adapt.

## It's right thing for the user.
It's hard to argue that Gmail's tabbed inbox is not an incredibly good user experience. It smartly filters all those pesky marketing emails into a tab where they can be looked at later or (more likely) overlooked entirely.

Some companies have tried to get their emails into the highly-sought "Primary Inbox" using tactics like this:

Sending an email like this is like airing an ad asking people to stop fast forwarding through ads. It's pointless and it's slimy. It's not the right thing for the user; it's the right thing for your metrics.

Customers are loyal to companies that care about them. They distrust companies that don't. As soon as you violate your users' trust, they become exponentially more likely to switch to an competitor or a substitute, and once they're gone, it's very costly to win them back.

## They weren't reading anyway.
The hard truth we as email marketers need to cope with is that a minority of the people we email actually engage with the emails we send. Industry-wide open rates for marketing emails are ~13%. That means ~87% of the people we're emailing, don't open the emails we send them.

MailChimp [recently released an analysis](http://blog.mailchimp.com/how-gmails-new-inbox-is-affecting-open-rates/) of the billions of emails they send. It turns out open rates only dropped 50 bps (13% to 12.5%):

This means that the people who weren't opening our emails before the Tabbed Inbox still aren't opening our emails. This doesn't help us, but the pain inflicted not nearly as bad as it could've been. 

## It isn't going away.
I bring this up because marketers are trying to

As a user, I love it, but as a marketer, I fear it. I see my own behavior with Google's Tabbed Inbox manifest itself in the numbers. As my own personal open and click-thru rates decline, so do the open and click-thru rates of the camapaigns I work on. As I stop checking the "Promotions" and "Social Updates" tabs, so do thousands of Gmail users who increasingly spend time in their primary inboxes as the novelty burns in and they begin to stop checking what's building up in those tabs.

## It's time to get creative.
And then, I took a step back and realized it's going to be okay. 

The world will keep spinning, and your users will keep clicking.

When TiVo was introduced in 1999, marketers and advertisers freaked out. The government of Singapore even banned it to protect its local media industry.
