> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle

Researchers have recently validated what great thinkers like Aristotle have long known was true: The way to be successful is to form habits around successful activities. The more you practice, the better you are, and the better you are, the more successful you'll be.

The digital generation has given us unparalleled access to software that helps us form the habits we need to create the habits we need to be successful. Here's a list of the apps I use to develop and practice my habits:

1. [Lift](http://www.lift.do/). I'll admit that it wasn't easy to get started with Lift.

2. [100](http://www.giveit100.com/).

3. [Any.do Moment](http://www.any.do/).
