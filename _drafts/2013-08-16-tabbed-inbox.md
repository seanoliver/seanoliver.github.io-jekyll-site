I have a small rant to share on Google's new tabbed inbox. On one hand, I'm a Gmail user who hates sifting through countless promotions to get to the emails from people I really care about. On the other hand, I'm a marketer at a consumer web company who deals a lot with the email channel as a means of driving my business.

In short, I'm conflicted. 

As a user, I love it, but as a marketer, I fear it. I see my own behavior with Google's Tabbed Inbox manifest itself in the numbers. As my own personal open and click-thru rates decline, so do the open and click-thru rates of the camapaigns I work on. As I stop checking the "Promotions" and "Social Updates" tabs, so do thousands of Gmail users who increasingly spend time in their primary inboxes as the novelty burns in and they begin to stop checking what's building up in those tabs.

I remember chuckling silently to myself has major email brands like Gilt and Groupon almost immediately humbled themselves to the mercy of Gmail's tabs:

And what's more, I remember seeing deeper interactions fall by the wayside
