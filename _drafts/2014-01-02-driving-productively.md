One of the bigger stories in the news this year was the Federal Highway Administration's report that indicated [Americans are no longer driving as much as they once were](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/stats-show-americans-not-driving-anymore). The reasons are obvious: Owning a car is expensive, young people are opting to live in cities with public transit, and technology is making it less and less necessary for us to meet [IRL](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRL).

That said, driving is still the [killer app](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application) to get most Americans from A to B.

In fact when all is said and done, I spent a total of _24 hours and 8 minutes_ driving:

That's a lot of time spent slamming Starbucks and looking at break lights, and until [cars start driving themselves](#), that's about all you can do during all those hours behind the wheel.
