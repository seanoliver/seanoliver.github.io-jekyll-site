A recent report from the Federal Highway Administration report said [Americans are no longer driving as much as they once were](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/stats-show-americans-not-driving-anymore). Owning a car is expensive, young people are opting to live in cities with public transit, and technology continues to reduce the need for meetings [IRL](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRL). Of course, that doesn't change the fact that we're still a car culture.

Driving continues to be the primary way most Americans get from A to B. During this holiday seasona alone, I spent time visitng friends and family all around the [Mid-Atlantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_states) to places like Philadelphia, New York, Annapolis, and Binghamton (to name a few). In fact when all is said and done, I spent a total of _24 hours and 8 minutes_ driving.

That's a lot of time spent looking ahead and trying to stay awake, but until [cars start driving themselves](#), it seems like all one can do is stare at break lights and slam some Starbucks. Fear not, though, I've compiled some suggestions 

1. **[Audible](http://audible.com/).** I love reading a good book, but I seldom make the time to do so with everything else I've got going on day-to-day. Audible is an [Amazon](http://amazon.com) service that provides a huge library of audio books to download and listen to on all of your devices. I like to listen to audio books on 2x speed, which Audible and other audio book apps (e.g. [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/features/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-music-itu)) also provides.

2. **[Umano](http://umanoapp.com/).** I read blogs to keep up on news, but reading TechCrunch while driving is worse than texting while driving. Well fear not; the folks at Umano have you covered. Umano takes the top news stories from the most popular blogs on the web and has real, professional voice actors read them to you. Once a story is complete, Umano starts reading the next one in the queue so you can keep your eyes on the road. I find listening to Umano as enjoyable as listening to [NPR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR). It turns mind-numbing idle time into opportunities to get smarter.

3. **iOS Speak Selection.** Okay, this isn't an app, but it's super useful for turning all of the other types of written content you may encounter into audio-based goodness. If you have an iOS device, you can enable Speak Selection by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > Speak Selection > (On/Off). Turning this on gives you the option to have your phone read aloud any piece of text you highlight. Here are some popular use cases I've encountered:

	1. Reading _Wikipedia articles_ aloud to settle arguments with other passengers in the car
	2. Reading _Yelp reviews_ aloud to decide where to go to dinner
	3. Reading _movie showtimes_ aloud to figure out which one you can make
	4. Reading _text messages_ aloud to determine if they're worth having a passenger 'ghost write' a response for you

4. **Podcasts.**
