I was born in a [small town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrose,_Pennsylvania) in northeast PA, a.k.a. "NEPA" (pronounced _nee-pa_). In 2012, the population of my hometown was 1,582. Since then, I've mostly lived in bigger towns. I currently live in San Francisco, and I love it here.

I am a product marketer on the [growth](http://www.quora.com/Growth-Hacking/What-is-growth-hacking) team at [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/). In 2011, I [taught myself to code](https://github.com/seanoliver) and built my first side-project, [Shoflow](http://shoflow.com).

When I'm not hacking away on the internet, I try to spend my time learning new things. I'm currently learning how to speak Chinese and play guitar.
