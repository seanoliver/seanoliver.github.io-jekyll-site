I was born in a [small town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrose,_Pennsylvania) in northeast PA, a.k.a. "NEPA" (pronounced _nee-pa_). In 2012, the population of my hometown was 1,582. Since then, I've mostly lived in bigger towns. I currently live in San Francisco, and I love it here.

I am a product marketer at [Optimizely](http://www.optimizely.com/). In 2011, I [taught myself to code](https://github.com/seanoliver) and built my first project, [Shoflow](http://shoflow.com). I'm also working on a few other things I hope to launch soon.

When I'm not [in the office](http://www.linkedin.com/in/soliver87/) or hacking away on the internet, I try to [spend my time](https://www.facebook.com/seane) learning new things. I'm currently learning how to speak Chinese and [play guitar](https://giveit100.com/@seanoliver).
