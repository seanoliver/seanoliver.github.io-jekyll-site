  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A recent report from the Federal Highway Administration report said &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/stats-show-americans-not-driving-anymore&quot;&gt;Americans are no longer driving as much as they once were&lt;/a&gt;. Owning a car is expensive, young people are opting to live in cities with public transit, and technology continues to reduce the need for meetings &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRL&quot;&gt;IRL&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that doesn’t change the fact that we’re still a car culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving continues to be the primary way most Americans get from A to B. During this holiday seasona alone, I spent time visitng friends and family all around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_states&quot;&gt;Mid-Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; to places like Philadelphia, New York, Annapolis, and Binghamton (to name a few). In fact when all is said and done, I spent a total of &lt;em&gt;24 hours and 8 minutes&lt;/em&gt; driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of time spent looking ahead and trying to stay awake, but until &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;cars start driving themselves&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like all one can do is stare at break lights and slam some Starbucks. Fear not, though, I’ve compiled some suggestions &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audible.com/&quot;&gt;Audible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I love reading a good book, but I seldom make the time to do so with everything else I’ve got going on day-to-day. Audible is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; service that provides a huge library of audio books to download and listen to on all of your devices. I like to listen to audio books on 2x speed, which Audible and other audio book apps (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/features/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-music-itu&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;) also provides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://umanoapp.com/&quot;&gt;Umano&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I read blogs to keep up on news, but reading TechCrunch while driving is worse than texting while driving. Well fear not; the folks at Umano have you covered. Umano takes the top news stories from the most popular blogs on the web and has real, professional voice actors read them to you. Once a story is complete, Umano starts reading the next one in the queue so you can keep your eyes on the road. I find listening to Umano as enjoyable as listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. It turns mind-numbing idle time into opportunities to get smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS Speak Selection.&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, this isn’t an app, but it’s super useful for turning all of the other types of written content you may encounter into audio-based goodness. If you have an iOS device, you can enable Speak Selection by going to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Accessibility &amp;gt; Speak Selection &amp;gt; (On/Off). Turning this on gives you the option to have your phone read aloud any piece of text you highlight. Here are some popular use cases I’ve encountered:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;Wikipedia articles&lt;/em&gt; aloud to settle arguments with other passengers in the car&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;Yelp reviews&lt;/em&gt; aloud to decide where to go to dinner&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;movie showtimes&lt;/em&gt; aloud to figure out which one you can make&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;text messages&lt;/em&gt; aloud to determine if they’re worth having a passenger ‘ghost write’ a response for you&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcasts.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” - Aristotle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have recently validated what great thinkers like Aristotle have long known was true: The way to be successful is to form habits around successful activities. The more you practice, the better you are, and the better you are, the more successful you’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital generation has given us unparalleled access to software that helps us form the habits we need to create the habits we need to be successful. Here’s a list of the apps I use to develop and practice my habits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lift.do/&quot;&gt;Lift&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll admit that it wasn’t easy to get started with Lift.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Modern tech workers have more things to do than time to do them. Requests come from every direction, and tasks pile up quickly if you’re not always trying to stay on top of it. I’ve tried a variety of GTD and task management workflows over the years, but none of them stuck. Each method took so much time to manage that it took away from time I could be spending getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time I borrowed aspects of other GTD systems and hobbled together a method that’s worked for me. It’s called the Do folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/do-folder.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Do Folder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-do-folder&quot;&gt;What is the Do folder?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a given day I get inbound tasks from email, meetings, phone calls, texts, and so on. Keeping track of everything that has to be done takes time, and that’s where most productivity workflows tend to fall down. Over time, I’ve started to do a good job at keeping track of things in apps. I use a lot of apps to get things done, and each one has it’s own purpose. The Do folder is where I keep all those apps, all the apps I need to take action on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-put-in-it&quot;&gt;What do you put in it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Do folder won’t work if you don’t use it. This is why it’s important to keep a few key “anchor apps” inside. Anchor apps are apps that you’ll always use no matter what, because you have to (e.g. Mail and Calendar). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you add other apps that you &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to use. There are a lot of great apps out there that can keep you productive if you use them, but using them daily means you need to turn them into habits, and that’s hard. Adding these apps in the Do folder with your other Anchor apps ensures you’ll see them and reminds you to open them. It’s a kind of &lt;em&gt;halo effect&lt;/em&gt;, so I call them “Halo apps.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-anchor-apps&quot;&gt;My Anchor Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mailbox&lt;/em&gt;. For keeping track of the email that actually needs action taken on it. As I’ve written before, &lt;a href=&quot;/email-notifications&quot;&gt;I don’t use push notifications for email&lt;/a&gt; but Mailbox does have a useful badge notification setting I use. It shows the total count of emails in your inbox, rather than unread email only. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any.DO&lt;/em&gt;. This is my to do list of choice for keeping a handle on everything that needs to get done that does not come in via email. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5985481/anydo-moment-offers-a-quick-simple-overview-of-your-daily-to+dos&quot;&gt;Any.DO Moment&lt;/a&gt; every morning to prioritize my tasks for the day. The badge counter only shows the tasks I need to complete for that day, so when the folder is closed, the folder’s badge number shows the sum of Mailbox and Any.DO—an overall count of what needs to get done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Calendar&lt;/em&gt;. I still prefer Apple’s default Calendar app, but their badge notifications are usually innacurate, so I turn them off entirely. Calendar is important enough to my day that I don’t need a notification to get me into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-halo-apps&quot;&gt;My Halo Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/em&gt;. I use it every day to keep track of my diet and exercise and make sure that I’m generally improving my fitness. It’s part of a daily personal fitness committment I’ve made to myself, which is why it made the cut for the Do folder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lift&lt;/em&gt;. I use Lift to keep myself accountable for the various repeatable tasks that I want to do every day and turn into habits. I’ve had the app for a while, but only when I put it in the Do folder did I make it a daily habit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evernote&lt;/em&gt;. My Evernote workflow is constantly evolving. I use an ‘Inbox’ note (a la David Allen) to keep track of everything I need to organize later—things like book recommendations, notes to go into Any.DO tasks, and ideas for side projects or startup companies. Keeping it here makes sure I keep it top of mind and reorganize it when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s different in how they get things done, so maybe this exact implementation won’t work for you. That’s fine. Maybe part of it will. At the end of the day being productive is about what you &lt;strong&gt;produce&lt;/strong&gt;. The important thing is not to overthink it and commit to the things that work.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was first opted into Google’s new tabbed inbox in Gmail, it immediately changed the way I used my email. It’s similar to the effect DVR had on the way I experienced TV. Just like DVR, Gmail’s tabs allow users to get to the content they care about without having to be pushed to buy some item they don’t want or engage with some product they don’t care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I’m a marketer at a consumer web company, and like many internet marketers today, I rely on the email channel to get users using my products. It would be easy for me to feel frustrated about the change, and to seek out workarounds. But the hard truth is that the email marketing landscape has changed, and it’s time we learn to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-right-thing-for-the-user&quot;&gt;It’s right thing for the user.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to argue that Gmail’s tabbed inbox is not an incredibly good user experience. It smartly filters all those pesky marketing emails into a tab where they can be looked at later or (more likely) overlooked entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies have tried to get their emails into the highly-sought “Primary Inbox” using tactics like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gilt_tabs.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Gilt's desperate attempt to get into the Primary Inbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending an email like this is like airing an ad asking people to stop fast forwarding through ads. It’s pointless and it’s slimy. It’s not the right thing for the user; it’s the right thing for your metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers are loyal to companies that care about them. They distrust companies that don’t. As soon as you violate your users’ trust, they become exponentially more likely to switch to an competitor or a substitute, and once they’re gone, it’s very costly to win them back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;they-werent-reading-anyway&quot;&gt;They weren’t reading anyway.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard truth we as email marketers need to cope with is that a minority of the people we email actually engage with the emails we send. Industry-wide open rates for marketing emails are ~13%. That means ~87% of the people we’re emailing, don’t open the emails we send them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MailChimp &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mailchimp.com/how-gmails-new-inbox-is-affecting-open-rates/&quot;&gt;recently released an analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the billions of emails they send. It turns out open rates only dropped 50 bps (13% to 12.5%):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mailchimp_tabs.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Open rates declined from 13% to 12.5% after Gmail's Tabbed Inbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the people who weren’t opening our emails before the Tabbed Inbox still aren’t opening our emails. This doesn’t help us, but the pain inflicted not nearly as bad as it could’ve been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-isnt-going-away&quot;&gt;It isn’t going away.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because marketers are trying to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a user, I love it, but as a marketer, I fear it. I see my own behavior with Google’s Tabbed Inbox manifest itself in the numbers. As my own personal open and click-thru rates decline, so do the open and click-thru rates of the camapaigns I work on. As I stop checking the “Promotions” and “Social Updates” tabs, so do thousands of Gmail users who increasingly spend time in their primary inboxes as the novelty burns in and they begin to stop checking what’s building up in those tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-time-to-get-creative&quot;&gt;It’s time to get creative.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, I took a step back and realized it’s going to be okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world will keep spinning, and your users will keep clicking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When TiVo was introduced in 1999, marketers and advertisers freaked out. The government of Singapore even banned it to protect its local media industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No. Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Yoda (The Empire Strikes Back, 1980)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoda’s immortal words reflect a flawed situation in American society: We’ve stopped trying. We’ve stopped trying, and instead, we’ve started doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve started doing because doing implies finishing and—more importantly—succeeding. Trying, on the other hand, means that you’re struggling. It indicates you could fail at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would you catch a ride with a friend who tries to drive?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would you hire someone who tries to work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would you agree to surgery from a doctor who tries to operate? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not. Why would you? After all, if you’re trying, you’re struggling. And if you’re struggling, you’re probably about to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this line of thinking overlooks this simple fact: &lt;em&gt;Everyone must try before they can do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying is how we learn. It’s how we explore. It’s how we improve. It’s how we discover things about ourselves and about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would the world look like if Leonardo da Vinci never tried to paint? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where would we be if Steve Jobs never tried to sell a computer? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if Martin Luther King, Jr. never tried to raise his voice? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these people, there was a period during which they needed to try before they could start doing. However in today’s overly critical society, it can be hard to find the motivation to try, to pursue new interests, and to go after big ideas (or small ones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t try, you won’t do. And if you don’t do, you won’t succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So try.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We sit more than we do anything else. We spend 9.3 hours per day sitting, as opposed to 7.7 hours sleeping. We sit on the way to work, we sit through meetings, we sit while we eat, we sit while we talk, we sit to relax… We sit a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-sit&quot;&gt;Why do we sit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much sitting has been shown to lead to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Sitting is actually killing us and we aren’t doing anything to stop it. But not sitting is easier said than done. A quick look at the alternatives, standing and walking, makes it obvious why sitting is superior: it’s easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easier to go to work sitting in a car or on a train. It’s easier to be in meetings while&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time we started walking. Walking is an easy antidote to all of the problems excessive sitting can cause. But it’s not always easy to find time to walk. After all, we sit because it’s easy to do things while sitting. It’s easier to eat while sitting. It’s easier to use the computer while sitting. It’s even easier to talk while sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 3 simple ways I’ve found to help me increase my sit-to-walk ratio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walking Meetings and Standups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk to work&lt;/li&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I moved to San Francisco a little over a year ago, I’ve felt the excitement of being surrounded by people who are trying to change the world. It’s inspiring to talk to people about what they’re working on and hear their amazing stories about how they’re transforming industries and upending the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if they’re lucky (and that’s a big if), they start to gain traction. They’re making money, they’re winning customers, and they’re getting attention. Before they know it, countless opportunities come knocking. To be more specific: exit opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the
six months that they need for digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my ﬁrst drawing. 
My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sticker-mule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing Number One&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
drawing frightened them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a
hat?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor
digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it,
I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the
grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe — so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog — at least I had him for a few days until he ran away — and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college — one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “Yale News.”— and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York — and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, I decided to try an experiment and turn off email notifications on my phone and my laptop. I’d read a lot online about the benefits of turning off email notifications, but I was always afraid to try it for fear of missing something important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a month of this, I can safely say I’m not going back. My stress level has decreased, and my ability to focus has never been better. I have a greater appreciation for the world around me, and my general happiness level has hugely improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notifications-make-everything-seem-urgent&quot;&gt;Notifications make everything seem urgent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notifications do everything they can to get your attention. They appear, they flash, they vibrate, they chime. They don’t let you ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really useful when they information they carry is urgent. But it usually isn’t:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgent:&lt;/strong&gt; A close friend was bitten by a poisonous snake and only has minutes to live. You alone possess the antidote.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Urgent:&lt;/strong&gt; A coworker needs to know why we’re seeing a WoW decline in DAU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an extreme example, but the point is very few things require an immediate reply. After turning off notifications, I find myself setting aside time to look at email when it’s convenient for me. Then I can prioritize my replies relative to all of the unread emails in my inbox, rather than processing each one as it comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notifications-make-you-less-effective&quot;&gt;Notifications make you less effective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how you look at it, the point of a notification is to get you to pay attention to something other than what you’re doing. But there are lots of times, when you need constant, unbroken attention to get something done effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a generic experience I’d often have before turning off notifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Begin working on project that requires focus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Receive email notification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Glance at it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the email and skim it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider how long it will take to respond and how urgent it is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decide it’s not worth a response right now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flag it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remind myself what I was doing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get back to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole process happens in a few seconds, so it doesn’t feel like a huge tax. But in reality, it breaks up your thought process, causing you to make mistakes and ultimately increasing the amount of time it takes to get the task done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notifications-consume-your-attention&quot;&gt;Notifications consume your attention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times has this happened to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re walking down the hallway.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You receive an email notification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You pull out your phone and read the email, while walking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You you arrive at your destination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You put your phone away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was going on around you between when you started walking and when you arrived at your destination? Hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days without notifications, I noticed how much more often I was bumping into people and having quick conversations. I realized that some of the walls of my office building were painted blue and others white. I noticed there were cherry blossom trees in the courtyard outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without notifications, I’m getting a lot more out of my days. I have more control over my time, and I finish the things I start more quickly. I’m learning more about the people I work with, and I pay more attention to the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I agree with the cacophony of criticism about Apple’s latest round of TV ads. In fact, I almost had an allergic reaction to them when I first saw them air during the Olympics opening ceremony on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They looked and felt like ads that my former employer, Microsoft, used to release in attempt to position themselves as being relevant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many issues abound:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t show the product.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a product ad, not a brand ad or a perception ad. And Apple has always impressed me by the way that they have (almost) always made the product the star of their product ads. Consumers need to see what’s being advertised in order to understand the messaging in a tangible way. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t explain the product.&lt;/strong&gt; Apple doesn’t always show the product in its ads. A great example of this is the Mac vs. PC campaign that ran through the first half of the 2000s. But that campaign still made the product the star by focusing on each ad on a discrete feature or set of related features, and explaining how they work. That’s something that this campaign utterly fails at doing. In the ad above, the Genius asks the shopper, “It came loaded with all the great apps like iMovie, iPhoto, Garageband… Not ringing a bell?” The consumer at whom this ad is targeted doesn’t know what these apps are. As a result, he doesn’t know why he should care that he doesn’t have them. And if the ad doesn’t tell him that, he’s just going to hear marketing noise and tune out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They make the target audience feel stupid.&lt;/strong&gt; This is Apple’s first real effort going after a less tech-savvy group of computer buyers, and this ad makes it clear that they really don’t know how to talk to them at all. The people in this segment are not idiots, in fact, a lot of them are doctors, lawyers, teachers, and otherwise very smart people.They just don’t think about the latest technology all that much, and this ad basically calls them stupid for not buying a Mac. When consumers buy PCs, they are usually doing it after lots of research — after all, it’s a big purchase for most people — and this ad is essentially telling them they made the wrong decision despite all the thought they put into making what they thought was the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They make the Geniuses look like unsupportive know-it-alls.&lt;/strong&gt; In a similar vein, the Apple Genius in this ad comes off as a true embodiment of the elitist stereotype many have attributed to Apple’s core customer. When Apple first introduced the Geniuses, they worked because they weren’t that stereotype. No one wants to buy a computer from a cocky teenager who thinks their questions are stupid and that they’re wasting his time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no clear call to action.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve alluded to this a little already, but the most important thing missing from this ad is that there’s absolutely zero payoff. No moral. No happy ending. Nothing to tell the consumer what they should take away and do next. They don’t even explain that these “friendly” Geniuses can be found right by where you live at your local Apple Store. This is a product ad targeted at people who don’t know anything about the product, and Apple fails in the most fundamental way by not telling them anything about it or even where to buy it.
When I was with Microsoft, I saw vapid creative like this get created and published all the time. It wasn’t because people at Microsoft didn’t know what they were doing. There were and there continue to be a lot of extremely talented people at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collateral like this happens when there is no creative vision coming down from senior leaders. When leaders delegate the vision downward, middle managers end up having to make the final call, but in almost all cases they don’t have the power to do so alone. So, they go about securing buy-off from multiple teams, and the result was leadership by committee. Not exactly the Apple way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been much said about whether Tim Cook can steer the great ship that is Apple into another decade of innovation. While he may still be getting his sea legs, this ad along with other marketing blunders over the past few months make it clear that this is no longer Steve Jobs’ Apple, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;
