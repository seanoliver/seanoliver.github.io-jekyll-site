    <div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Modern tech workers have more things to do than time to do them. Requests come from every direction, and tasks pile up quickly if you&#39;re not always trying to stay on top of it. I&#39;ve tried a variety of GTD and task management workflows over the years, but none of them stuck. Each method took so much time to manage that it took away from time I could be spending getting things done.</p>

<p>Over time I borrowed aspects of other GTD systems and hobbled together a method that&#39;s worked for me. It&#39;s called the Do folder:</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/do-folder.png" alt="My Do Folder">
</center></p>

<h2>What is the Do folder?</h2>

<p>On a given day I get inbound tasks from email, meetings, phone calls, texts, and so on. Keeping track of everything that has to be done takes time, and that&#39;s where most productivity workflows tend to fall down. Over time, I&#39;ve started to do a good job at keeping track of things in apps. I use a lot of apps to get things done, and each one has it&#39;s own purpose. The Do folder is where I keep all those apps, all the apps I need to take action on.</p>

<h2>What do you put in it?</h2>

<p>The Do folder won&#39;t work if you don&#39;t use it. This is why it&#39;s important to keep a few key &quot;anchor apps&quot; inside. Anchor apps are apps that you&#39;ll always use no matter what, because you have to (e.g. Mail and Calendar). </p>

<p>Then you add other apps that you <em>want</em> to use. There are a lot of great apps out there that can keep you productive if you use them, but using them daily means you need to turn them into habits, and that&#39;s hard. Adding these apps in the Do folder with your other Anchor apps ensures you&#39;ll see them and reminds you to open them. It&#39;s a kind of <strong>halo effect</strong>, so I call them &quot;Halo apps.&quot;</p>

<h3>My Anchor Apps</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Mailbox.</strong> For keeping track of the email that actually needs action taken on it. As I&#39;ve written before, <a href="/email-notifications">I don&#39;t use push notifications for email</a> but Mailbox does have a useful badge notification setting I use. It shows the total count of emails in your inbox, rather than unread email only. </li>
<li><strong>Any.DO.</strong> This is my to do list of choice for keeping a handle on everything that needs to get done that does not come in via email. I use <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5985481/anydo-moment-offers-a-quick-simple-overview-of-your-daily-to+dos">Any.DO Moment</a> every morning to prioritize my tasks for the day. The badge counter only shows the tasks I need to complete for that day, so when the folder is closed, the folder&#39;s badge number shows the sum of Mailbox and Any.DO---an overall count of what needs to get done.</li>
<li><strong>Calendar.</strong> I still prefer Apple&#39;s default Calendar app, but their badge notifications are usually innacurate, so I turn them off entirely. Calendar is important enough to my day that I don&#39;t need a notification to get me into it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>My Halo Apps</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>MyFitnessPal.</strong> I use it every day to keep track of my diet and exercise and make sure that I&#39;m generally improving my fitness. It&#39;s part of a daily personal fitness committment I&#39;ve made to myself, which is why it made the cut for the Do folder.</li>
<li><strong>Lift.</strong> I use Lift to keep myself accountable for the various repeatable tasks that I want to do every day and turn into habits. I&#39;ve had the app for a while, but only when I put it in the Do folder did I make it a daily habit.</li>
<li><strong>Evernote.</strong> My Evernote workflow is constantly evolving. I use an &#39;Inbox&#39; note (a la David Allen) to keep track of everything I need to organize later---things like book recommendations, notes to go into Any.DO tasks, and ideas for side projects or startup companies. Keeping it here makes sure I keep it top of mind and reorganize it when necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone&#39;s different in how they get things done, so maybe this exact implementation won&#39;t work for you. That&#39;s fine. Maybe part of it will. At the end of the day being productive is about what you <em>produce</em>. The important thing is not to overthink it and commit to the things that work.</p>
